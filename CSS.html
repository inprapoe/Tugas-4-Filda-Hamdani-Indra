                CSS is what’s called a Cascading Style Sheet language, and is used to stylize elements written in a markup language such as HTML. It separates the content from the visual representation of the site.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS was developed by W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996, for a rather simple reason. HTML was not designed to have tags that would help format the page. You were only supposed to write the markup for the site.            </p>
            <p>
                Tags like font were introduced in HTML version 3.2, and it caused quite a lot of troubles for developers. Since websites had different fonts, colored backgrounds, and styles, it was a long, painful, and expensive process to rewrite the code. Thus, CSS was created by W3C to solve this problem.
            </p>
            <p>
                The relation between HTML and CSS is strongly tied together. Since HTML is a markup language (the very foundation of a site) and CSS emphasizes style (all of the aesthetics of a website), they go hand in hand together.
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS is not technically a necessity, but you probably wouldn’t want to look at a site that features only HTML as it would look completely bare-boned.
